                    this field is purely cosmetic. While this can be an important part of their work, it is vital to
                    note that facial anomalies can have a devastating impact on people’s lives. They may, for
                    example, be unable to chew, struggle to breathe, suffer medical conditions such as sleep apnoea
                    or be shunned by society because of their unusual appearance.”</p>
