                            Patients often assume the only difference between the oral procedures dental practitioners
                            perform and those that maxillofacial and oral surgeons do, is that MFO surgeons charge more
                            than the former. This canâ€™t be further from the truth and could cost a patient dearly
                            especially with regard to particular oral or facial procedures.

                        <h3><strong>Academic expertise in medical, dental and surgery</strong></h3>

                        <p>
                            As a minimum requirement, a South African MFO surgeon must complete a five-year dentistry
                            degree followed by a five-year postgraduate hospital-based residency training programme. Not
                            all candidates follow the same route to becoming an MFO surgeon. Some candidates enter the
                            residency programme with a medical degree and need to still complete a three-year dentistry
                            degree, other candidates may enter the programme with both the dentistry and medical
                            qualifications in hand.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The postgraduate training programme includes rotations in general surgery, intensive care,
                            trauma, plastic and reconstructive surgery, ophthalmology, ear, nose, and throat surgery,
                            paediatric surgery and oral pathology, with dedicated clinics in orthognathic surgery,
                            implantology, oncology, temporomandibular joint surgery, pre-prosthetic surgery and oral
                            pathology, implantology, craniofacial surgery and facial clefts including cleft lip and
                            palate. <a class="has-text-info" href="<?php echo e(route('ask')); ?>#procedures">Click here</a> for a full list of procedures.

                        <h3><strong>Dental practitioner or MFO surgeon?</strong></h3>

                        <p>
                            Dental practitioners are skilled and knowledgeable about overall oral health and are trained
                            for correcting a variety of dental issues, like dental restorations and associated ailments,
                            root canals, dental crowns or denture fitting issues.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although MFO surgeons also perform some of these procedures, they have undergone specialist
                            training to address more complex dental and medical issues associated with the head, mouth,
                            jaws, and neck, and can perform more extensive surgeries in both hard and soft tissue
                            regions, correcting a range of minor and major skeletal and dental deformities, including
                            the misalignment of facial structures and teeth. This also includes correcting trauma of the
                            face, facial cleft deformities, orthognathic deformities, doing reconstruction, and treating
                            tumours and cancers, temporomandibular joint problems and facial pain.
